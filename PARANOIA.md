# PARANOID MODE

> Can you help me occupy my brain?

In **production**, MicroGP is typically run from a non-interactive script, for example on a server with ssh access. In this context, performance is critical, while verbosity should be minimal. During the **setup**, on the other hand, the user needs to check the various parameters and the coherence of the constraints. Here, speed is not essential, while warnings and hints can be quite useful. 

MicroGP's ***paranoia checks*** are computationally intensive routines  that thoroughly analyze and verify both the integrity of the internal data structures and the  parameter values, providing error messages and hints. *Paranoia checks* are supposed to be used only during the setup phase, and they are automatically removed when an optimization flag is used.

## Terminal

If *paranoia checks* are enabled, the user is warned of the potential, indeed almost certain, loss in performance:

> Paranoia checks are enabled: performances can be significantly impaired — consider using '-O'

Possible solutions.

### Use `-O` flag

Using an optimization flag will disable *Paranoia Checks*:

```sh
$ python -O ./super-fuzzer.py
```

### Set `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`

Setting the environment variable [`PYTHONOPTIMIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONOPTIMIZE) to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the `-O` option:

```sh
$ PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 python ./super-fuzzer.py
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

By default, code run in IPython is not optimized. MicroGP should detect when it is executed within a Jupyter Notebook and show a warning:

> Paranoia checks are enabled in this notebook: performances can be significantly impaired

Possible solutions.

### Set `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`

It may be enough to set [`PYTHONOPTIMIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONOPTIMIZE) before starting Jupyter:

```shell
$ PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 jupyter-notebook
```

### Export to a script

* In Jupyter, from menu `File`, choose `Save and Export Notebook As...`, and then `Executable Script`.
* Enable optimization when running the script from the terminal (see above).

### Use magic

Jupyter allows some of the IPython's [magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html), and a *cell magic* (`%%`) can be used to start a Python interpreter with an optimization flag:

```jupyterpython
%%python -O

import microgp4 as ugp

# All super-fuzzer code
```

* :+1: May be used in remote Notebooks (e.g., [Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))
* :-1: All the code must be packed into one single cell
* :-1: MicroGP will not detect Jupyter anymore

### Tamper with the bytecode cache

:warning: This hack may cause your system to become unstable and/or provide incorrect results. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any harm or damage that may result from it.

* Generate the optimized bytecode (e.g., run `python -O -m pytest`)
* Locate all the folders that contain compiled bytecode (e.g., `**/__pycache__`)
* Substitute all bytecode-compiled files (e.g., `*.pyc`) with their optimized versions (e.g., `*.opt-1.pyc`)
