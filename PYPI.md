MicroGP (µGP, `ugp`)  is an [evolutionary tool](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/evolution.html) created around 2001. Over the years it has been exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), and as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas. [Some hundreds documents](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+OR+ugp3+OR+ugp2+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+OR+Sanchez+OR+Schillaci+%29) discussing it and possible application can be found in the scientific literature.
